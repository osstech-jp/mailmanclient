===================
Mailman REST client
===================

    >>> import os
    >>> import time
    >>> import subprocess

    >>> from mocker import Mocker
    >>> mocker = Mocker()

This is the official Python bindings for the GNU Mailman REST API.  In order
to talk to Mailman, the engine's REST server must be running.  You begin by
instantiating a client object to access the root of the REST hierarchy,
providing it the base URL, user name and password (for Basic Auth).

    >>> from mailman.client import Client
    >>> client = Client('http://localhost:8001/3.0', 'restadmin', 'restpass')

We can retrieve basic information about the server.

    >>> dump(client.system)
    http_etag: "..."
    mailman_version: GNU Mailman 3.0... (...)
    python_version: ...
    self_link: http://localhost:8001/3.0/system

To start with, there are no known mailing lists.

    >>> client.lists
    []


Domains
=======

Before new mailing lists can be added, the domain that the list will live in
must be added.  By default, there are no known domains.

    >>> client.domains
    []

It's easy to create a new domain; when you do, a proxy object for that domain
is returned.

    >>> example_dot_com = client.create_domain('example.com')
    >>> example_dot_com
    <Domain "example.com">
    >>> print example_dot_com.base_url
    http://example.com
    >>> print example_dot_com.contact_address
    postmaster@example.com
    >>> print example_dot_com.description
    None
    >>> print example_dot_com.mail_host
    example.com
    >>> print example_dot_com.url_host
    example.com

You can also get an existing domain independently using its mail host.

    >>> example = client.get_domain('example.com')
    >>> example
    <Domain "example.com">
    >>> print example_dot_com.base_url
    http://example.com
    
Additionally you can get an existing domain using its web host. 

    >>> example = client.get_domain(web_host='http://example.com')
    >>> example
    <Domain "example.com">
    >>> print example_dot_com.base_url
    http://example.com

But you cannot retrieve a non-existent domain.

    >>> client.get_domain('example.org')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    HTTPError: HTTP Error 404: 404 Not Found

After creating a few more domains, we can print the list of all domains.

    >>> client.create_domain('example.net')
    <Domain "example.net">
    >>> client.create_domain('example.org')
    <Domain "example.org">
    >>> for mail_host in client.domains:
    ...     print mail_host
    <Domain "example.com">
    <Domain "example.net">
    <Domain "example.org">
    
Also, domain can be deleted.

    >>> client.delete_domain('example.org')
    >>> for mail_host in client.domains:
    ...     print mail_host
    <Domain "example.com">
    <Domain "example.net">


Mailing lists
=============

Once you have a domain, you can create mailing lists in that domain.

    >>> test_one = example.create_list('test-one')
    >>> test_one
    <List "test-one@example.com">
    >>> print test_one.fqdn_listname
    test-one@example.com
    >>> print test_one.mail_host
    example.com
    >>> print test_one.list_name
    test-one
    >>> print test_one.display_name
    Test-one

You can also retrieve the mailing list after the fact.

    >>> my_list = client.get_list('test-one@example.com')
    >>> my_list
    <List "test-one@example.com">

And you can print all the known mailing lists.
::

    >>> example.create_list('test-two')
    <List "test-two@example.com">
    >>> domain = client.get_domain('example.net')
    >>> domain.create_list('test-three')
    <List "test-three@example.net">
    >>> example.create_list('test-three')
    <List "test-three@example.com">

    >>> for mlist in client.lists:
    ...     print mlist
    <List "test-one@example.com">
    <List "test-three@example.com">
    <List "test-three@example.net">
    <List "test-two@example.com">
    
If you only want to know all lists for a specific domain, use the domain object.

    >>> for mlist in example.lists:
    ...     print mlist
    <List "test-one@example.com">
    <List "test-three@example.com">
    <List "test-two@example.com">

You can use a list instance to delete the list.

    >>> test_three = client.get_list('test-three@example.net')
    >>> test_three.delete()

You can also delete a list using the client instance's delete_list method.

    >>> client.delete_list('test-three@example.com')

    >>> for mlist in client.lists:
    ...     print mlist
    <List "test-one@example.com">
    <List "test-two@example.com">


Membership
==========

Email addresses can subscribe to existing mailing lists, becoming members of
that list.  The address is a unique id for a specific user in the system, and
a member is a user that is subscribed to a mailing list.  Email addresses need
not be pre-registered, though the auto-registered user will be unique for each
email address.

The system starts out with no members.

    >>> client.members
    []

New members can be easily added; users are automatically registered.
::

    >>> test_two = client.get_list('test-two@example.com')

    >>> test_one.subscribe('anna@example.com', 'Anna')
    <Member "anna@example.com" on "test-one.example.com">
    >>> test_one.subscribe('bill@example.com', 'Bill')
    <Member "bill@example.com" on "test-one.example.com">
    >>> test_two.subscribe('anna@example.com')
    <Member "anna@example.com" on "test-two.example.com">
    >>> test_two.subscribe('cris@example.com', 'Cris')
    <Member "cris@example.com" on "test-two.example.com">

We can retrieve all known memberships.  These are sorted first by mailing list
name, then by email address.

    >>> for member in client.members:
    ...     print member
    <Member "anna@example.com" on "test-one.example.com">
    <Member "bill@example.com" on "test-one.example.com">
    <Member "anna@example.com" on "test-two.example.com">
    <Member "cris@example.com" on "test-two.example.com">

We can also view the memberships for a single mailing list.

    >>> for member in test_one.members:
    ...     print member
    <Member "anna@example.com" on "test-one.example.com">
    <Member "bill@example.com" on "test-one.example.com">

We can get a single membership too.

    >>> cris = test_two.get_member('cris@example.com')
    >>> cris
    <Member "cris@example.com" on "test-two.example.com">
    >>> print cris.role
    member
    >>> print cris.self_link
    http://localhost:8001/3.0/members/...
    >>> print cris.user
    http://localhost:8001/3.0/users/...

If you use an address which is not a member of test_two `ValueError` is raised:

    >>> test_two.unsubscribe('nomember@example.com')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ValueError: nomember@example.com is not a member address of test-two@example.com

After a while, Anna decides to unsubscribe from the Test One mailing list,
though she keeps her Test Two membership active.

    >>> test_one.unsubscribe('anna@example.com')
    >>> for member in client.members:
    ...     print member
    <Member "bill@example.com" on "test-one.example.com">
    <Member "anna@example.com" on "test-two.example.com">
    <Member "cris@example.com" on "test-two.example.com">

A little later, Cris decides to unsubscribe from the Test Two mailing list.

    >>> cris.unsubscribe()
    >>> for member in client.members:
    ...     print member
    <Member "bill@example.com" on "test-one.example.com">
    <Member "anna@example.com" on "test-two.example.com">

If you try to unsubscribe an address which is not a member address `ValueError` is raised:

    >>> test_one.unsubscribe('nomember@example.com')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ValueError: nomember@example.com is not a member address of test-one@example.com


Users
=====

Users are people with one or more list memberhips. To get a list of all users, access the clients user property.

    >>> for user in client.users:
    ...     print user
    <User "..." (...)>
    <User "..." (...)>
    <User "..." (...)>

A single user can be retrieved using their email address.

    >>> cris = client.get_user('cris@example.com')
    >>> print cris.display_name
    Cris

Every user has a list of one or more addresses. 

    >>> for address in cris.addresses:
    ...     print address
    ...     print address.display_name
    ...     print address.registered_on
    cris@example.com
    Cris
    ...

Addresses can be accessed directly:

    >>> address = client.get_address('cris@example.com')
    >>> print address
    cris@example.com
    >>> print address.display_name
    Cris

The address has not been verified:

    >>> print address.verified_on is None
    True

But that can be done via the address object:

    >>> address.verify()
    >>> address.verified_on is None
    False

It can also be unverified:

    >>> address.unverify()
    >>> address.verified_on is None
    True


Users can be added using ``create_user``. The display_name is optional:
    >>> client.create_user(email='ler@primus.org',
    ...                    password='somepass',
    ...                    display_name='Ler')
    <User "Ler" (...)>
    >>> ler = client.get_user('ler@primus.org')
    >>> print ler.password
    $...
    >>> print ler.display_name
    Ler

User attributes can be changed through assignment, but you need to call the
object's ``save`` method to store the changes in the mailman core database.

    >>> ler.display_name = 'Sir Ler'
    >>> ler.save()
    >>> ler = client.get_user('ler@primus.org')
    >>> print ler.display_name
    Sir Ler

Passwords can be changed as well:

    >>> old_pwd = ler.password
    >>> ler.password = 'easy'
    >>> old_pwd == ler.password
    True
    >>> ler.save()
    >>> old_pwd == ler.password
    False


List Settings
=============

We can get all list settings via a lists settings attribute. A proxy object for the settings is returned which behaves much like a dictionary.

    >>> settings = test_one.settings
    >>> len(settings)
    47

    >>> for attr in sorted(settings):
    ...     print attr + ': ' + str(settings[attr])
    acceptable_aliases: []
    ...
    welcome_message_uri: mailman:///welcome.txt

    >>> print settings['display_name']
    Test-one

We can access all valid list settings as attributes.

    >>> print settings['fqdn_listname']
    test-one@example.com
    >>> print settings['description']

    >>> settings['description'] = 'A very meaningful description.'
    >>> settings['display_name'] = 'Test Numero Uno'

    >>> settings.save()

    >>> settings_new = test_one.settings
    >>> print settings_new['description']
    A very meaningful description.
    >>> print settings_new['display_name']
    Test Numero Uno

The settings object also supports the `get` method of usual Python dictionaries:

    >>> print settings_new.get('OhNoIForgotTheKey', 'HowGoodIPlacedOneUnderTheDoormat')
    HowGoodIPlacedOneUnderTheDoormat


Preferences
===========

Preferences can be accessed and set for users, members and addresses.

By default, preferences are not set and fall back to the global system preferences. They're read-only and can be accessed through the client object.

    >>> global_prefs = client.preferences
    >>> print global_prefs['acknowledge_posts']
    False
    >>> print global_prefs['delivery_mode']
    regular
    >>> print global_prefs['delivery_status']
    enabled
    >>> print global_prefs['hide_address']
    True
    >>> print global_prefs['preferred_language']
    en
    >>> print global_prefs['receive_list_copy']
    True
    >>> print global_prefs['receive_own_postings']
    True


Owners and Moderators
=====================

Owners and moderators are properties of the list object.

    >>> test_one.owners
    []
    >>> test_one.moderators
    []

Owners can be added via the ``add_owner`` method:

    >>> test_one.add_owner('foo@example.com')
    >>> for owner in test_one.owners:
    ...     print owner
    foo@example.com

The owner of the list not automatically added as a member:

    >>> test_one.members
    [<Member "bill@example.com" on "test-one.example.com">]

Moderators can be added similarly:

    >>> test_one.add_moderator('bar@example.com')
    >>> for moderator in test_one.moderators:
    ...     print moderator
    bar@example.com

Moderators are also not automatically added as members:

    >>> test_one.members
    [<Member "bill@example.com" on "test-one.example.com">]

Members and owners/moderators are separate entries in in the general members
list:

    >>> test_one.subscribe('bar@example.com')
    <Member "bar@example.com" on "test-one.example.com">

    >>> for member in client.members:
    ...     print '%s: %s' %(member, member.role) 
    <Member "bar@example.com" on "test-one.example.com">: moderator
    <Member "bar@example.com" on "test-one.example.com">: member
    <Member "bill@example.com" on "test-one.example.com">: member
    <Member "foo@example.com" on "test-one.example.com">: owner
    <Member "anna@example.com" on "test-two.example.com">: member

Both owners and moderators can be removed:

    >>> test_one.remove_owner('foo@example.com')
    >>> test_one.owners
    []

    test_one.remove_moderator('bar@example.com')
    test_one.moderators
    []


Moderation
==========

    >>> from mailman.client._client import _Connection
    >>> connection = mocker.patch(_Connection)
    >>> connection.call('lists/test-one@example.com/held', None, 'GET')
    <mocker.Mock object at ...>
    >>> mocker.result([200, {'entries': [
    ...     {u'data': {
    ...         u'_mod_subject': u'Something',
    ...         u'_mod_fqdn_listname': u'test-one@example.com',
    ...         u'_mod_hold_date': u'2005-08-01T07:49:23',
    ...         u'_mod_reason': u'Because',
    ...         u'_mod_sender': u'anne@example.com',
    ...         },
    ...      u'id': 123,},
    ...     ]}])
    >>> connection.call('lists/test-one@example.com/held/123', dict(action=u'defer'), 'POST')
    <mocker.Mock object at ...>
    >>> mocker.result([204, {u'status': 204}])
    >>> mocker.replay()

Messages held for moderation can be listed on a per list basis.

    >>> held = test_one.held
    >>> print held[0]['subject']
    Something
    >>> print held[0]['reason']
    Because
    >>> print held[0]['id']
    123

    >>> result = test_one.defer_message(held[0]['id'])
    >>> print result
    204

    >>> mocker.restore()
