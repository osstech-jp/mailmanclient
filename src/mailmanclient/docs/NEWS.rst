Changes
-------

  additional `display_name` argument that allows associating display names with
  these memberships.
* Add a new API ``Client.find_lists`` which allows filtering mailing lists
  related to a subscriber. It optionally allows a role, which filters the lists
  that the address is subscribed to with that role.

Backwards Incompatible Changes
-------------------------------

* `MailingList.owners` and `MailingList.moderators` now returns a list of
  `Member` objects instead of a list of emails.

  JSON response. (:pr:`63`)
